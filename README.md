## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quests

**Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words:**

  A decentralized record or ledger of transcations that is open to all to view and it is immutable.

**Explain what a Smart Contract is:**

  Basically programs/functions that anyone can call on and run. It then sends the data to the blockchain to be written to

**Explain the difference between a script and a transaction:**

  Transcation is a function call that costs money whether that is tokens or coins on that particular blockchain. There's usually some sort of fuel needed.
  
  Scripts are used to view data that is already on the blockchain. No money needed for that piece


## Chapter 2 Day 2 Quests

**What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**

Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming

**In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**

This foundation sets a great standard so that it encourages builders from all over to bring new ideas. Coding shouldn't be something that is gatekept by obscure syntax.
